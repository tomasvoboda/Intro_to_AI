# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (B4B36ZUI / BE4B36ZUI)

This repository contains a collection of tasks and solutions developed as part of the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course at Czech Technical University (CTU). The course covers fundamental AI concepts, including state-space search, problem-solving methods, reinforcement learning, knowledge representation, and decision-making under uncertainty.

## Course Overview:

The assignments in this repository focus on implementing and applying AI algorithms to solve various problems. The course does not cover classical machine learning, as that is the focus of separate courses.

## Tasks:

- Task 1: Path Planning (A)* - Implementing the A* algorithm for optimal path planning in a block world.
- Task 2: Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning) - Developing a reinforcement learning agent to learn policies in uncertain environments.
- Task 3: Two-Player Game (Monte Carlo Tree Search - MCTS) - Implementing a game-playing AI using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for Gomoku.

## Goals:

- Understand and implement state-space search algorithms (informed and uninformed).
- Apply reinforcement learning to decision-making problems.
- Develop AI strategies for two-player competitive games.
- Gain hands-on experience with problem-solving methods used in AI.

## Technologies Used:

- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- A* Algorithm, Q-Learning, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
- AI Search & Planning Techniques
